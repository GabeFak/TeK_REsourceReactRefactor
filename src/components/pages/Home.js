        <p>I've always had a need to hoard anything related to electronic music. CD's, records, rave flyers, MP3s, PDFs of academics talking about Stockhausen and Xenakis, 2SK30A-O transistors, the same Stussy jumper that Goldie wore. Anything. . . </p>
        <p>So I've decided to make a little space for myself and my obsession that others may find interesting. TeK_REsource is, at heart, an abstract online index of esoteric electronic music related content that I've obsessively engaged with on an everyday bases for the past ten or so years. Everything from electronic dance music related archives to open source music software.</p>
        <p>Make some tea, grab a hard drive with a few terabytes free on it, and get downloading/ripping/torrenting/etc. . . !</p>
